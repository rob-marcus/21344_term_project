This file contains the ground truth matting data used in the paper
A. Levin, A. Rav-Acha and D. Lischinski, "Spectral Matting"
In Proceeding of CVPR 2007.

The data consists of three examples (lion, monster and monkey), each having:
- alpha matte.
- several images with different backgrounds.
- one additional image with a blue background.

To compute the alpha matte, the 3 dolls were captured in front of a computer
monitor displaying multiple backgrounds. Later, the foreground objects were
moved and a free background image was captured.
Having captured the foreground object in front of multiple known backgrounds,
we have enough constraints to solve for alpha, using triangulation as
described by:
A. Smith and J. Blinn "Bluee Screen Mattin",É, SIGGRAPH 1996.

Note that for dark image areas the measurements were amplified by noise and
the computed alpha is slightly smaller than 1, even for fully opaque areas
(see for example the monster teeth).
