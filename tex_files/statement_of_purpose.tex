\textbf{Statement of Purpose}

We (Darren Zhang, Robbie Marcus) will be replicating a somewhat-recent research paper in spectral mating, as it pertains to performing soft image segmentation (e.g., the \verb|Zoom| feature that enables users to generically blur the backgrounds.) The basis of our replication will be translating the source material from a mix of \verb|matlab| and \verb|cpp| to \verb|python|.

Our GitHub repository is located at: $$\verb|https://github.com/rob-marcus/21344_term_project|$$

The research paper we are using can be found in our repository under \verb|ref_materials/Spectral mating.pdf|.
